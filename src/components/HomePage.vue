            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>Programming is one of the major leads that plays an important role in Computer Science. As it can always be sharpened by only practice, hence having better platform to practice and compete is
            essential. Participating in contests at a good platform leads to a better improvement in coding skills.</p>
